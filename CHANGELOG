=== TBD

* Added extensive unit tests
* Extended functional test coverage
* Refactored code into modules and out of stripe/__init__.py
* Abstracted http library selection and use from the `APIRequestor` into `stripe.http_client`
* Refactored `StripeObject` to inherit from `dict` and avoid direct access of `__dict__`.
* PEP8ified the codebase and enforced with a test.
* Proper encoding of timezone aware datetimes

Backwards Incompatible Changes

* The `to_dict` and `values` methods on resources no longer recursively convert objects to plain dicts.
* The `previous_metadata` attribute on resources is now private.
* Timezone aware `datetime` objects passed to the API will now be encoded in a way that does not depend on the local system time.  This may change the value passed to the API.
