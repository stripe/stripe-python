# E501 is the "Line too long" error. We disable it because we use Black for
# code formatting. Black makes a best effort to keep lines under the max
# length, but can go over in some cases.
# W503 goes against PEP8 rules. It's disabled by default, but must be disabled
# explicitly when using `ignore`.
ignore = E501, W503
