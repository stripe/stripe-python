    The Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and
    billing management.

    A portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you
    want to provide to your customers through the portal.

    A portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for
    a particular customer. By visiting the session's URL, the customer
    can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons,
    sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL.
    Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions
    and billing details.

    Learn more in the [integration guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/integrating-customer-portal).
