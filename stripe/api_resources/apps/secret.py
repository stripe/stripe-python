class Secret(CreateableAPIResource, ListableAPIResource):
    """
    Secret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.

    The primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can't view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.

    All Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don't change per-user, like a third-party API key.

    A `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.
