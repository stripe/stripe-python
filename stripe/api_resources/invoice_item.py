    Invoice Items represent the component lines of an [invoice](https://stripe.com/docs/api/invoices). An invoice item is added to an
    invoice by creating or updating it with an `invoice` field, at which point it will be included as
    [an invoice line item](https://stripe.com/docs/api/invoices/line_item) within
    [invoice.lines](https://stripe.com/docs/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-lines).

    Invoice Items can be created before you are ready to actually send the invoice. This can be particularly useful when combined
    with a [subscription](https://stripe.com/docs/api/subscriptions). Sometimes you want to add a charge or credit to a customer, but actually charge
    or credit the customer's card only at the end of a regular billing cycle. This is useful for combining several charges
    (to minimize per-transaction fees), or for having Stripe tabulate your usage-based billing totals.
