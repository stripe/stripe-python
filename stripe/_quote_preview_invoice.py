class QuotePreviewInvoice(ListableAPIResource["QuotePreviewInvoice"]):
    """
    Invoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either
    generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.

    They contain [invoice items](https://stripe.com/docs/api#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments
    that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).

    If your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges,
    Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note
    that finalizing the invoice,
    [when automatic](https://stripe.com/docs/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does
    not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits
    until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last
    webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have
    connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after
    creation to finalize the invoice.

    If your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your
    [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic),
    Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These
    emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.

    Stripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the
    amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually
    charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe's [minimum allowed charge
    per currency](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the
    invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the
    customer's credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.

    More details on the customer's credit balance are
    [here](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/customer/balance).

        see the history of payment attempts for a particular session.

        A PaymentIntent transitions through
        [multiple statuses](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/intents#intent-statuses)
        throughout its lifetime as it interfaces with Stripe.js to perform

        A SetupIntent guides you through the process of setting up and saving a customer's payment credentials for future payments.
        For example, you can use a SetupIntent to set up and save your customer's card without immediately collecting a payment.
        Later, you can use [PaymentIntents](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intents) to drive the payment flow.

        Create a SetupIntent when you're ready to collect your customer's payment credentials.
        Don't maintain long-lived, unconfirmed SetupIntents because they might not be valid.
        The SetupIntent transitions through multiple [statuses](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/intents#intent-statuses) as it guides
        you through the setup process.

        Successful SetupIntents result in payment credentials that are optimized for future payments.
        For example, cardholders in [certain regions](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication) might need to be run through
        [Strong Customer Authentication](https://stripe.com/docs/strong-customer-authentication) during payment method collection
        to streamline later [off-session payments](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/setup-intents).
        If you use the SetupIntent with a [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#setup_intent_object-customer),
        it automatically attaches the resulting payment method to that Customer after successful setup.
        We recommend using SetupIntents or [setup_future_usage](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intent_object-setup_future_usage) on
        PaymentIntents to save payment methods to prevent saving invalid or unoptimized payment methods.

        By using SetupIntents, you can reduce friction for your customers, even as regulations change over time.
