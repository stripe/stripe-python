"""
event_notification_webhook_handler.py - receive and process event notifications (AKA thin events) like the v1.billing.meter.error_report_triggered and v1.billing.meter.no_meter_found events.

In this example, we:
    - create a StripeClient called client
    - use client.parse_event_notification() to parse the received notification webhook body
    - if its type is "v1.billing.meter.error_report_triggered":
        - call event_notification.fetch_related_object() to retrieve the Meter that failed
        - call event_notification.fetch_event() to retrieve the full event object
        - log info about the failure
    - if its type is "v1.billing.meter.no_meter_found":
        - call event_notification.fetch_event() to retrieve the full event object
        - log info about the failure
    - if the SDK doesn't have types for it, it will be an UnknownEventNotification:
        - optionally cast it to UnknownEventNotification to get more accurate typing
        - match on the type property to handle specific unknown event types
