# packages needed to run static analysis (lints, types, etc)
# version requirements: any modern python version (currently 3.10)

# typechecking for all versions
# can't use `>=1.1.339` since it flags override issues, e.g.:
# > Method "_cls_delete" overrides class "DeletableAPIResource" in an incompatible manner Parameter "**params" has no corresponding parameter Pylance(reportIncompatibleMethodOverride)
# can probably fix/ignore these issues and move forward, but we're stuck until then
pyright == 1.1.336
# general typechecking
mypy == 1.7.0
# formatting
ruff == 0.9.6
