    # so don't depend on anything from a more recent version than that.
    #
    # If we need something newer, maybe we can provide it for users on
    # newer versions with a conditional import, but we'll cross that
    # bridge when we come to it.

    # If a symbol exists in both `typing` and `typing_extensions`, which
    # should you use? Prefer `typing_extensions` if the symbol available there.
    # in 4.1.1. In typing_extensions 4.7.0, `typing_extensions` started re-exporting
    # EVERYTHING from `typing` but this is not the case in v4.1.1.
